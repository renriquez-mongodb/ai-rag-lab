# 📘 Components of a RAG system

RAG systems have two main components: **Retrieval** and **Generation**.

## Retrieval

Retrieval mainly involves processing your data and constructing a knowledge base in a way that you are able to efficiently retrieve relevant information from it. It typically involves three main steps:

* **Chunking**: Break down large pieces of information into smaller segments or chunks.

* **Embedding**: Convert a piece of information such as text, images, audio, video, etc. into an array of numbers a.k.a. vectors.

* **Semantic Search**: Retrieve the most relevant documents from the knowledge base based on embedding similarity with the query vector.

## Generation

Generation involves crafting a prompt that contains all the instructions and information required by the LLM to generate accurate answers to user queries.
