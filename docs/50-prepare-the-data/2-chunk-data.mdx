# 👐 Chunk up the data

Since we are working with large documents, we first need to break them up into smaller chunks before embedding and storing them in MongoDB.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 4: Chunk up the data** section in the notebook to chunk up the articles we loaded.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:
