# 👐 Generate embeddings

To perform vector search on our data, we need to embed it (i.e. generate embedding vectors) before ingesting it into MongoDB.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 5: Generate embeddings** section in the notebook to embed the chunked articles.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_4**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
embedding_model.encode(text)
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_5**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
doc["embedding"] = get_embedding(doc["body"])
```
</div>
</details>

:::caution
If the embedding generation is taking too long (> 5 min), kill/interrupt the cell and move on to the next step with the documents that have been embedded up until that point.
